# baseline-scripts for temporal-point-transformer
Extra utility codes used to run baselines smoothly, for JRDB dataset and semantic kitty dataset. 

## semantic kitty scripts
- the files are placed in `training_script_semantic_kitty` directory

- semantic kitty dataset structure, Download it from here [SemanticKITTI](http://www.semantic-kitti.org/dataset.html#download) (including **Velodyne point clouds**, **calibration data** and **label data**).
- instructions for JRDB will be added soon and scripts are in `training_script_JRDB` directory
```

# sequences for testing: 08
```

- activate the evironment (the environment file is environment.yml)
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate lidar_moseg
pip install e .
```
- to run and test the train dataloader and test dataloader script (move this script to the dataloader directory in codebase which ever is used)
```
python3 dataloaders/semantic_kitty.py
```
- to run the training script use (-m to be used when running in a module otherwise it not reqired also put this code in scripts directory)
```
tmux new -s training
tmux a -t training
python3 -m scripts.train_semantic_kitty.py 
```
- to use the first GPU on your system incase  it is not detected use this
```
export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0
```
- To run the evaluation script for semantic kitty use
```
python3 -m scripts.eval_semantic_kitty --config_path <path>/config/semantic_kitty_config.yaml --checkpoint_path <path>/best-checkpoint-epoch=07-val_loss=0.00-v1.ckpt
```

- the utilities for point cloud  processing is present in `pointcloud_utils.py` and the config used for training along with the split is present in config folder in `semantic_kitty_config.yaml`

## Results
- by default, wandb logging is turned on, so if you wish to use your wandb account, please make a .env file, with your wandb api key as follows
```
WANDB_API_KEY=<YOUR-API-KEY>
```
- also change the `semantic-kitty-config.yaml` to add the details
```
logging:
  wandb:
    run_root_dir: "/scratch/<username>/temporal-point-transformer"
    project: "add your project here"
    entity: "add your entity here"
    log_model: False
    save_code: False
    group: "temporal-point"
    name: "patch64-semantic-kitty"
    resume: "never"
    log_dir: "/scratch/<username>/temporal-point-transformer/logs"
```
- Blue line is on JRDB dataset and red line is on Semantic kitty dataset

- In Scripts folder `eval_semantic_kitty.py` should print the output below in this way for sequence 8
```

## Visualization
- use rerun to visualize the result.
```
rerun --serve & disown
python3 -m scripts.visualize_semantic_kitty --config_path <path>/config/semantic_kitty_config.yaml --checkpoint_path <path>/best-checkpoint-epoch=07-val_loss=0.00-v1.ckpt
```
- left side is the predictions and right side is the ground truth

## ROSbag processing for custom Dataset

- remember to change the directories in the bash scripts as per your directory path for seamless usage
```
# for ROS2 humble bags
./rosbag_processing_script/process_ros2_bag.sh

# for ROS1 noetic bags
./rosbag_processing_script/process_ros1_bag.sh
```

## Acknowledgment
- I have used [temporal-point-transformer](https://github.com/LiDAR-Motion-Segmentation/temporal-point-transformer) model to train and evaluate on.
